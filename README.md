# KeoviZ

Keyonz's Neovim config.

Careful the colorscheme is supposed to work with [KonfiZ](https://github.com/Keyoonz/KonfiZ) which generates automatically the colors based on the wallpaper.

## Installation
If you already have a config backup it or remove it and then you are good to install this configuration.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Keyoonz/KeoviZ ~/.config/nvim
```
